# Kaggle March Madness 2017

This is the repo for our submission to the Kaggle Machine Learning Mania 2017 contest.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017

## Getting Started

Any code I'm working on including data prep, machine learning etc. I'll try to put in a jupyter notebook.
I've also included the data files that Kaggle gave us. They will release the final matchups that
we will need to predict after selection Sunday. Once they release I'll put them here as well. Feel free to upload any other datasets that you think might help us. The Discussion section of the contest has some interesting datasets. I also encourage you to look at the previous year's contests to get some ideas.

### Prerequisites

I like to use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, numpy and scikit-learn for my data science
work. Feel free to use R or any other package that you are comfortable with. You can download
anaconda's distro of Python which also includes all of the packages I listed above to make it easier.
